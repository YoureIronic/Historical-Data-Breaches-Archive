## Description

In early 2023, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/200-million-twitter-users-email-addresses-allegedly-leaked-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200M records scraped from Twitter appeared on a popular hacking forum</a>. The data was obtained sometime in 2021 by abusing an API that enabled email addresses to be resolved to Twitter profiles. The subsequent results were then composed into a corpus of data containing email addresses alongside public Twitter profile information including names, usernames and follower counts.
